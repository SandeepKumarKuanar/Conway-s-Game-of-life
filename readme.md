# Conway's game of life
## Motivations
- This is my attempt to simulate conway's game of life
- This is an attempt to use only `numpy` for this project
- Slowly this git repository would start to grow and thus I would get chance to work piece by piece

## Setup and file structure
I have also added my VSCode setting of `tasks.json` file init, which would helps me 
1. **Call Python** the file in view
2. **Wait** for the input in the `input.txt` file 
3. **Run** the file and then show the output in the `output.txt` file
---
## Moving on the namings followed (would keep updating)
1. `conway.py` is the main file, that keeps running
2. `saves.py` is the code extracted to the date, those have a specific purpose 
3. the `./vscode` file has my `Call → Wait → Run` script
