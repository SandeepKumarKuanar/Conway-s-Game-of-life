This is a great hack for small, input/output‑driven problems where you want zero‑friction iteration on Linux. For any “real” C/C++ or Python application—multi‑file, cross‑platform, interactive, or needing debugging—you’ll eventually graduate to a proper build (Make/CMake/VS Code launch configurations for debug) and test runner. But for competitive programming, algorithm drills, or simple scripts, it’s dead simple and keeps your hands on the keyboard.
